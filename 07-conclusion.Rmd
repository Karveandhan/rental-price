We started this study with a hypothesis that,

## Hypothesis

The rent price drastically went down during the pandemic time due to less demand.

So, after analyzing the data collected, is the hypothesis that we assumed is true? - ***YES!***

## How?

* With the exception of New York, we can observe that the rental prices in each city follow the overall US rental price trend from 2019 to 2021. However, there is a noticeable modest reduction in rental prices in New York throughout the year 2020 (pandemic). 

* We also noticed that during the epidemic, the less popular cities had a spike in median rent, which was fueled in part by the widespread "Work From Home" initiatives.

* This tendency is also explained by the low mortgage rate during the pandemic.

* As a result, it is clear that the actual data supports our hypothesis.

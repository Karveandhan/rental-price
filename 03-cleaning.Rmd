# Data transformation
We downloaded data as csv files from <website> and transformed it based on our need. We selected the related variables only and transformed them into the format for plotting, by **dplyr** package functions such as `mutate()`, `select()`, `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()` and **tidyr** package functions like `gather()` and `spread()`.

We picked City, State, and median house prices, and used it for our EDA and other analysis.
In the interactive chart we wanted to explore various data sources in d3 and we used csv and static json created inside the html page.
